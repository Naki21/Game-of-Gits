House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark's buddy King Robert hands Ned the Iron Throne because he knows his wife and children are complete incompetent psychopaths who have no business running the realm and hes very sure that his wife is going to kill him anyway.
