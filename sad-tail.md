House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

He will die a horrible death.  He will be poisoned by his wife and then another guy will squeeze another guy's head until it explodes.

Most of the people you like throughout this story will most likely die... get used to it...

Hoder dies.
